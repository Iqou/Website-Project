        <p>Denji (デンジ?) is the titular protagonist of the Chainsaw Man manga and anime series. He is the main protagonist of the Public Safety Saga and the co-protagonist of the Academy Saga.
            <br><br>As a young boy, he inherits his father's debts from the Yakuza. After meeting Pochita, he becomes a Devil Hunter for the Yakuza in an attempt to clear his debt. Once the Yakuza, under 
            the control of a Devil, betrays him, he dies and Pochita becomes his heart. He is then revived and can become the Chainsaw Man (チェンソーマン Chensō Man?) by pulling a cord on his 
            chest. After meeting Makima, he became a Public Safety Devil Hunter as a member of Tokyo Special Division 4.</p>

        <p>Chainsaw Man refers to the transformed version of Denji after he merges with his pet devil, Pochita. This transformation 
            grants him the ability to sprout chainsaw blades from his body, which he uses as weapons to fight devils. In his Chainsaw 
            Man form, Denji becomes an unpredictable and powerful force in the battle against devils, combining raw strength and a 
            brutal, chainsaw-powered fighting style. His appearance is marked by a chainsaw emerging from his head and his arms, 
            making him a fearsome figure in the world of devil hunters. Despite his violent powers, Chainsaw Man's actions and 
            motivations are driven by Denji's deep desires, such as his quest for a better life, love, and recognition, all while 
            navigating a dangerous and often morally ambiguous world.</p>
